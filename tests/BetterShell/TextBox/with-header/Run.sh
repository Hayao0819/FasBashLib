TextBox "Message to you" << EOF

Hello FasBashLib !

It is the collection of functions for modern Bash

I have a plan to add functions for legacy bash and posix shell

I am going to continue this project while I think it is interesting

This TextBox's code may not be good. Please someone improve it
